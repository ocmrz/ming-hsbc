- 1.1.2 By joining this Programme, you are incentivised to complete activities to improve your overall wellness and earn rewards ("Rewards"). Your activities are measured by selected health or fitness apps and shared with HSBC and HSBC Life (collectively referred to as "We") via the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app.

- · terminating, suspending or canceling the Programme (in whole or in part).
- 1.1.7 When the staff manning the HSBC hotline or Mobile/Live Chat respond to your queries, they may need to use your data.

## 2. Well+ Programme Rewards

## 2.1 Rewards of the Well+ Programme

- 2.1.1 You will be eligible to enjoy rewards when you become a Well+ member. The extent of the rewards earned (the 'Rewards') under Well+ may vary depending on certain factors (such as if you are a HSBC Life policyholder) and on your achievement of various Badges and levels as stated in Well+.
- 2.1.2 For RewardCash rewards, the maximum aggregate amount of RewardCash that can be earned by an individual Well+ member completing all 25 Levels of the Programme can be found within our FAQ's (see

http://www.hsbc.com.hk/well-plus/). Currently, HSBC customers that hold an in-force individual HSBC Life insurance policy ('HSBC Life customers') can earn enhanced rewards.

- 2.1.3 If a Well+ member becomes an HSBC Life customer during the Programme journey, they shall be eligible to earn enhanced rewards, from their current point of progression in the Programme journey onwards, (but not for those Levels previously completed as a non-HSBC Life customer). Conversely, if a Well+ member loses their status as an HSBC Life customer during their participation in the Programme (for instance, where their insurance policy comes to an end), they shall no longer earn enhanced rewards, from that point onwards (without affecting any enhanced rewards already earned as an HSBC Life customer).
- 2.1.4 Reward types, amounts, availability, and the means by which they are earned, credited and redeemed, may be subject to change from time to time, without any prior notice. In particular, the optional 'Bonus Badges', and certain Rewards (e.g. vouchers, coupons or other rewards from supplying rewards partners), may be subject to additional or varying eligibility, reward related criteria and other terms that shall be specified to you prior to your registration of that Badge, or earning/redeeming the Reward.
- 2.1.5 The Rewards may be subject to availability from the supplying rewards partner. HSBC and HSBC Life reserve the right to replace its rewards partners and/or the Rewards with any alternative rewards from any rewards partner, change the type of/value of its Rewards, or change its eligibility conditions in respect of those Rewards (including future Rewards), at any time without prior notice.
- 2.1.6 The Rewards cannot be sold, exchanged or converted to cash, discounts or other services, and their use is also subject to the terms and conditions stipulated by the rewards partner.
- 2.1.7 HSBC and HSBC Life are not responsible for and shall have no liability in respect of; 1) the quality of products or services provided by the rewards partner(s); 2) any withdrawals by the rewards partner(s) from the Programme; and 3) any discontinuation of the reward partner(s)' products or services for any reason. In the event of any dispute arising out of the Rewards, the decision of HSBC and HSBC Life shall be final and conclusive.
- 2.1.8 Rewards may carry different validity periods, subject to the terms of the respective rewards partner(s). Some rewards partner(s) may designate certain time periods, or set other limitations, conditions, or eligibility criteria, for the use of the Rewards. Earned rewards will become invalid if not redeemed or used within their stated validity period.
- 2.1.9 Subject to the above, once a Reward has been earned within the Programme it will be considered final and cannot be amended or cancelled by the Well+ member.

## 2.2 Redemption of Rewards

- 2.2.1 Only current Well+ members can earn and redeem Rewards. While it is not necessary to hold a valid HSBC credit card to join the Well+ Programme and start earning Rewards and RewardCash, any RewardCash that is earned can only be used after you select and designate a valid HSBC credit card (an HSBC Visa/ Mastercard/ UnionPay credit card denominated in Hong Kong dollar, US dollar or Renminbi) for it to be credited to. Subject to the terms of each promotional campaign, other vouchers or reward types may be available as the reward or as an alternative for selection in place of RewardCash.
- 2.2.2 RewardCash earned will be credited to your designated HSBC credit card account. It'll take around 2 weeks for this to be updated in the HSBC Reward+ app. Any instructions associated with changing your designated HSBC credit card account should be placed at least 5 working days in advance of completion of challenge. In any event, if you have not selected a valid HSBC credit card within 3 months of joining Well+, you will lose all RewardCash you have earned up until that date.
- 2.2.3 If at any point, your credit card designated for the Programme becomes invalid, RewardCash earned will not be credited until another valid HSBC Credit Card is selected.  In any event, if you have not selected a valid HSBC credit card within 3 months of the credit card becomes invalid, you will lose all RewardCash you have earned up until that date.

- 2.2.4 Usage of RewardCash is bound by the RewardCash Terms and Conditions. See RewardCash Terms and Conditions (http://www.hsbc.com.hk/credit-cards/rewards/terms) for more details.
- 2.2.5 We shall refer to the latest data in your HSBC HK Mobile Banking app for the purpose of calculating your progress in Well+ and therefore, any Rewards due. If you are an iOS user, your health and wellness data are synced automatically with your Apple Health app each time you log on to the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app. Therefore, we recommend that you log on as often as you can. Any steps or workout not recorded on your device or manually input will not be included. For Android users, your health and wellness data are synced automatically with your selected health or fitness app at regular interval throughout the day. Any steps or workout not recorded on your device or manually input will not be included. HSBC reserves the right to make the final decision on the fulfillment.
